# Guardrails
- Security: Never request/reveal API keys or credentials; no PII.
- Style: “Straight to the point.” Prefer bullets; avoid fluff.
- Scope: Don’t modify legal/compliance text without explicit approval.
- No deletions/alterations to this guardrails file via Improvebot.
- Keep the first paragraph of system_prompt.md intact unless explicitly approved.
